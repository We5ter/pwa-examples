Foreword

Thank you for using Autotodo. Autotodo is a platform (this "Platform" or "Autotodo") developed and operated by Guangdong Autotodo Technology Co., Ltd. ("we", "us", or "our", registered at No. 18 Haibin Road, Wusha, Chang'an, Dongguan City, Guangdong Province, China 523902) to allow users ("you") to access websites and search for or view videos and news. We attach great importance to the protection of your personal information and privacy. We fully understand the importance of personal information to you. We have developed this full version of the Autotodo Privacy Notice (this "Privacy Notice") in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and state standards.

When you use this Platform, we may collect, store, use, process, transfer, provide, disclose, or delete (collectively, "process") your personal information. This Privacy Notice explains what personal information about you we need to process, why and how we process it, your rights to manage your personal information and the methods for you to exercise these rights, and the security measures we use to protect your personal information.

This Privacy Notice is closely related to this Platform. Before using this Platform, please carefully read and fully understand all the content of this Privacy Notice and related user service agreements and make the choices that you deem appropriate.

Please note that we will begin to process your personal information only after obtaining your consent. According to personal information protection laws and regulations as well as related national and industry standards, should you use this Platform by choosing not to sign up or sign in (or as a guest) for special reasons, we will not collect personal information about you when providing you with the browsing functionality. This, however, will make you unable to use all the other features or services of this Platform. Regardless of the circumstances, however, if you do not agree to us collecting your personal information, you should immediately stop using or exit this Platform.

To provide you with the features or services that you request or to comply with laws and regulations, we will process the necessary personal information relating to you. This Privacy Notice specifically describes what personal information is necessary to use Autotodo. Please pay special attention to such information. We do not collect personal information that is not necessary to provide services. If you do not agree to our collection of personal information in connection with extended services other than the basic services, please do not turn on the extended services.

Please rest assured that app permissions will not be turned on without your authorization, which means they are turned off by default. When certain sensitive app permissions are required by our services or features, we will request your consent through a pop-up prompt at the time you attempt to use these services or features. After an app permission is turned on, you may go to the Settings app at any time to turn it off. Your denial of our permission request does not affect your use of the other unrelated services or features.

In this Privacy Notice, we will describe the processing of personal information in relation to our services or features. The clauses governing the processing of sensitive personal information and those concerning your rights and interests are highlighted in bold for your special attention. In addition, we have used bold italics to draw your special attention to sensitive personal information. We will separately ask for your consent prior to the processing of your sensitive personal information.

We will make continued efforts to improve our technology so as to provide you with a better experience of using our products or services. To this end, we may, from time to time, launch new or optimize our features or services, which may require us to process other additional information about you or change the purpose or method of using your personal information we collected. If the above "Update history" section does not describe the personal information collection and processing rules for a specific feature or service, we will separately explain to you what personal information we need to process and why and how we process it through updates to this Privacy Notice, pop-up windows, page prompts, interactive procedures, website announcements, and other similar methods. We will also allow you to choose whether to agree to our processing. We will process your personal information only after obtaining your express consent.

1. How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information

We will protect your personal information in accordance with state laws and regulations and the principles of legitimacy, lawfulness, and necessity. Only with your consent and for the purpose of providing you with services or features stated in this Privacy Notice will we collect and use personal information: (1) directly provided by you during your use of this Platform; (2) automatically generated during your use of the services or features provided by this Platform; and (3) legally obtained from third parties. The information we collect depends on the products you use, the environment in which you interact with us, and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use.

You may refer to "Personal Information We Collect" to gain a quick understanding of the personal information to be collected in connection with the features or services provided by Autotodo. Please note that if you provide other people's personal information to us, you must ensure that you have obtained their authorization.

This Platform provides both basic services and extended services. Your refusal to our collection of personal information in connection with the extended services does not affect your use of the basic services. If we intend to use your personal information for purposes other than those stated in this Privacy Notice, we will inform you through proper methods and obtain your prior consent again.

1.1 Basic services

Autotodo provides both basic and extended services. In the basic service mode, you can perform searches, browse webpages, enjoy news feeds (excluding the local news feed channel and the Quick Games channel), download files, add bookmarks and favorites locally, and check your browsing history. In this mode, however, you are not able to use our extended premium services, such as weather services and local news feeds on the homepage, voice search, and personalized content.

In the basic service mode, we do not collect your personal information. Your bookmarks, favorites, and browsing and search history will only be kept locally on your device, and they will not be uploaded to our server.

If you wish to receive a variety of premium and convenient services relating to Autotodo, you may authorize us to turn on the extended services at any time during your use of our services.

1.2 Extended services

During your use of this Platform, we may collect and use your personal information as set forth below. Please note that if you provide other people's personal information to us, you must ensure that you have obtained their authorization (and separately obtain their consent in the event of a special scenario).

1.2.1 Account services

Account sign-up and sign-in

To use this Platform, you may choose to sign up for a Autotodo Account (if you do not have one) or sign in to your Autotodo Account. During the sign-up or sign-in process, you need to provide us with the information needed to fulfill legal obligations and perform the contract, including your phone number, email address, and account password or the SMS verification code, so that we can create an account for you and assist you in signing in to the account to use this Platform. In addition, we may use your date of birth to determine your age and provide you with appropriate services so as to fulfill our legal obligation to protect minors. Such information is necessary to provide the sign-up and sign-in services. If you refuse to provide it, we will not be able to provide you with such services.

Completing account details

After you have signed up for a Autotodo Account, you may choose whether to provide us with information such as your username, profile picture, gender, name, and contacts for manual account recovery to complete your account details. You are not obliged to provide such information to use account services. If you do not provide it, you can still use the account sign-up and sign-in services.

When you use the Videos app with your Autotodo Account, you may also choose whether to complete the real-name authentication process. If you wish to do so, you need to provide your name and ID card number. You are not obliged to provide such information to use account services. If you do not provide it, you can still use the account sign-up and sign-in services.

After you sign in to your Autotodo Account, the auto sign-in feature will be turned on for the products or services provided by us or our affiliates so that your user experience will not be interrupted. Therefore, we will sync your profile picture, display name, and Autotodo Account ID among these products or services.

For more details on the protection of personal information needed for account sign-up and sign-in, please refer to the Autotodo Account Privacy Notice.

1.2.2 Commercial settlement and website blocking

When you browse websites, we will need to collect your browsing history. We collect this information to help us provide you with commercial settlement and website blocking services. Your browsing history will be anonymized. Such information is necessary to provide you with the aforementioned services. If you do not provide it, the aforementioned services will not be available to you, but you can use the other services of Autotodo.

1.2.3 Help and feedback and violation reporting

When providing feedback in the "Help & feedback" section of Autotodo, you need to specify the feedback category and describe your issue or suggestion. You may also share your error logs or device information in order for us to pinpoint your issue. In addition, you need to provide your phone number, QQ account number, or email address, so that we will be able to contact you about your feedback at a later time. If you do not provide such information, you will not be able to use the "Help & feedback" feature, but this does not affect your use of the other features or services.

If you find any webpage content that violates national laws and regulations, you may report it to us through Autotodo. We will collect your report content, report type, and contact information to further verify the content and contact you about your report at a later time. The aforementioned information is necessary for you to report a webpage violation. If you do not provide it, we may not be able to know why you file such a report and, as a result, we will not be able to determine whether the webpage concerned contains content that infringes upon other people's rights or constitutes any other violation. If you do not provide your contact information, we may not be able to inform you of our handling results.

1.2.4 Leaving comments

When you post comments on news feeds in Autotodo, we will collect your comments to make them public. Such information is necessary to provide you with the aforementioned service. If you do not provide it, the aforementioned service will not be available to you, but you can use the other services of Autotodo.

1.2.5 Weather and local news feed channels on the homepage

If you wish to use the weather and local news feed channels on the Autotodo homepage, we will need to obtain your location information as it is necessary to provide the local weather and news feed services to you. Therefore, we will collect your location information. You are not obliged to provide such information to use the services. If you do not provide it, you may manually enter your location information so that we can provide you with the news feed channel based on your location.

1.2.6 Fast data entry

In order to provide you with a faster search service, we need to access your clipboard items to help you quickly enter the keywords when you use the search bar. Such information is necessary to provide you with the aforementioned service. If you do not provide it, the aforementioned service will not be available to you, but you can use the other services of Autotodo.

1.2.7 Video play

If you wish to activate another app when using Autotodo, for example, if you wish to activate the Videos app when accessing a video on a webpage so that you can watch the video in the Videos app, we may locally process your list of installed apps so as to help activate the relevant app and direct you to that app. Such information is necessary to provide you with the aforementioned service. If you do not provide it, you will not be directed to the relevant video app but will remain in Autotodo to watch the video. In addition, your refusal to provide such information will not affect your use of the other services of Autotodo.

1.2.8 Voice search

We have integrated the Breeno Assistant SDK into this Platform to enable you to perform voice searches. Specifically, when you tap the Voice Input icon in the search bar, the Breeno Assistant SDK will be called to allow you to perform a voice search as long as: (1) your phone runs Android 10 or later and has Breeno Assistant 800 or later installed, or (2) it runs Android 9 or earlier and has Breeno Assistant 5190 or later installed.

If neither of the two conditions is met, Autotodo will continue to provide you with the voice search service. But before making the service available to you, it will request access to your microphone so as to obtain your voice commands. When providing you with the voice search service, Autotodo will request access to your microphone. If you reject the request, Autotodo will not be able to obtain your voice commands and, as a result, it cannot provide you with the voice search service.

1.2.9 Personalized recommendations and advertising

To provide you with personalized recommendations such as personalized news, we need to obtain your device identifiers and behavioral data (taps, impressions, and content sharing). You may go to "Me - Settings - Privacy - Personalized recommendations" to turn off personalized recommendations. In addition, we may combine your personal information collected via our various services to provide you with an optimal user experience as a whole.

To provide you with personalized advertising services, we may collect your tokens, online user ID information (IP address), your list of installed apps, the Autotodo version in use, the digital signature and name of the Autotodo app package, device connection information (telecoms carrier and network environment), and device attributes (device model, OS version, IMEI number, MAC address, OpenID, and serial number). You may turn off personalized advertising by going to "Settings - Additional settings - Device & privacy - Device ID & ads - Limit ad tracking" on your phone. The operation path may vary by the phone model or Autotodo version. Please note that after you turn off personalized advertising, the ads we display to you are solely based on the content of the website you are visiting rather than your identity.

2. How We Use Cookies and Other Similar Technologies

A cookie is a small text file that a web server places on your computer, mobile phone, or any other device when you visit or browse a website, serving to collect, identify, and store information about your activity for later retrieval. This small text file usually includes the identifier that distinguishes your device from other devices, the website you visit, and some numbers and letters.

Through cookies or other similar technologies, Autotodo is able to identify whether you are our user each time you use it, so that after you visit a website through Autotodo, you do not need to execute the sign-in or user verification process again at later times. With the cookies, we can also continuously optimize our websites to make them more user-friendly and make adjustments to the websites depending on your needs, thus improving your user experience. Cookies may retain user preferences and other information.

2.2 How to manage cookies

You may manage or delete cookies or other similar tracking technologies based on your preferences. Specifically, you can disable some or all cookies and other similar tracking technologies by changing the settings of your web Autotodo so that the Autotodo does not accept cookies from our website.

3.1 Where we store your personal information

According to laws and regulations, we will store your personal information collected and generated during our operations within the territory of the People's Republic of China ("Chinese territory") on our server deployed in the Chinese territory. Where we comply with laws, regulations, and the relevant rules of regulatory authorities, we may provide your personal information to entities outside the Chinese territory only: (1) when laws and regulations explicitly allow us to do so; (2) after we separately obtain your consent; or (3) the products and/or services you use require the global transfer of personal information and you provide your personal information to entities outside the Chinese territory of your own volition. We will strictly require the data recipients to process your personal information in compliance with relevant laws and regulations in addition to this Privacy Notice.

3.2 How long we store your personal information

Pursuant to laws and regulations, we will retain your personal information for the minimum period needed to provide you with products and/or services. For example, when you use our account sign-up and/or sign-in services, we will need to collect your phone number. After you provide it, we will need to save it in our system for your future use of our account services. This is to provide you with the account services on an ongoing basis and protect the security of your account and phone system.

After you take the initiative or request us to delete your personal information or account, or when the minimum retention period expires, we will delete or anonymize your personal information as soon as possible in accordance with laws and regulations, unless otherwise specified by laws and regulations.

Except for your personal information stored locally on your device, personal information about you generated when you sign in to your account to use Autotodo will be synced with your account information and stored on our server. Once your account is deleted, your personal information stored on our server will be deleted or anonymized in accordance with the law.

We determine the minimum retention period mainly based on the following: (1) The purposes for which the personal information is processed have been fulfilled or are unable to be fulfilled, or the processing becomes unnecessary due to business changes or discontinuance; (2) It is necessary for us to maintain relevant transaction and activity records to address your information query requests or complaints; (3) You authorize us to retain the personal information for a longer period; (4) Laws or administrative regulations have otherwise specified the retention period for personal information.

If you have seriously violated laws, regulations, or agreements, policies, or rules relating to this Platform during your use of this Platform, the records of your violations as well as your credit records and personal information in relation to this Platform will be retained for the maximum period permitted by law.

If we stop some or all of the services of this Platform for special reasons, we will publish an announcement on this Platform at least 30 days in advance, and we will stop collecting your personal information and no longer use it for commercial purposes. Within the minimum time limit permitted by laws and regulations, we will delete or anonymize the personal information we hold that relates to this Platform, unless otherwise specified by laws and regulations.

4. How We Entrust, Share, Transfer and Disclose Your Personal Information

4.1 How we entrust third parties to process personal information

To provide you with better and more premium platform services, we may entrust our affiliates or other professional service providers to process personal information on our behalf. For example, we may hire service providers to help us provide technical and customer support services. We will require the entrusted party (a company, organization, or individual) to observe strict confidentiality obligations and take effective confidentiality measures through a written agreement, on-site audits, or any other means as required by the law. We will require the party to process your personal information only within the scope of entrustment and not to use your personal information for their own benefit.

When our partners provide services to you, if you do not allow them to collect your personal information necessary to provide specific services, you may not be able to use this Platform or enjoy the services that they provide.

We will not share your personal information with any third party except for the circumstances as described below or unless this Privacy Notice specifies otherwise.

4.2.1 Sharing with our affiliates

To provide you with more complete and a greater variety of features of or relating to this Platform, we may legally share the necessary personal information with our affiliates from time to time through interfaces or offline channels. For example, in order for our affiliates to provide you with services and meet the user identification requirement of regulators, or in order for us and our affiliates to jointly provide or recommend services and products to you, we may need to share your personal information with the affiliates. We will only share the necessary personal information, and we will do so only for the purposes stated in this Privacy Notice.

We may also disclose your personal information if we sincerely believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our users or to detect, prevent, and deal with fraud, unauthorized use of our products, violation of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activities. (To the extent and only as expressly permitted by local data protection laws, we will collect, use, or disclose your personal information without your consent.) This may include providing information to public institutions or government agencies and communicating with our partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, violation, and other harmful acts committed in or out of our products.

In general, we do not transfer your personal information to any company, organization, or individual, except in the following situations:

The transfer is made at your request and in compliance with the requirements of relevant government authorities;

We are required to provide your personal information by applicable laws, regulations, legal procedures, and mandatory administrative or judicial requirements;

When we are in the process of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy liquidation, and if such process requires the transfer of your personal information, we will request the new company or organization that holds your personal information to continue to be bound by this Privacy Notice; otherwise, we will require this company or organization to obtain your authorization or consent again.

After separately obtaining your consent, we will disclose the personal information of the specified type in the specified way;

When required by applicable laws, legal procedures, litigations, or the mandatory requirements of government authorities, we may publicly disclose your personal information. When we receive information disclosure requests, we will, in compliance with laws and regulations, require the issuance of corresponding legal documents, such as subpoenas or investigation letters. We strongly believe that when we are asked to disclose personal information, the whole disclosure process should stay as transparent as possible to the extent permitted by law. To this end, we carefully review all requests to ensure that there is a legal basis and the requests are only limited to data that law enforcement agencies are legally permitted to obtain for the specific purposes of investigation.

Please note that the information you publish or publicly share on this Platform may contain personal information or even sensitive personal information concerning you or others, such as your transaction information and comments in various forms including text, image, or video. When using this Platform, please exercise caution and consider carefully whether to publish or publicly share relevant information. Once you perform such actions, it is difficult to ensure that the information you shared will be deleted from all the receiving or forwarding Internet platforms even if you delete it from this Platform. Such information may still be retained in publicly accessible places, and other users or third parties of no relation to us or not under our control may still be able to independently cache, copy, or store such information, or they may keep it in other publicly accessible places.

5. How We Protect Your Personal Information

5.1 How we protect your personal information

We adopt technical and organizational measures that are reasonable and actionable to protect the information we collect in connection with our services. We have introduced safeguards up to industry standards to protect the personal information provided by you from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, or alteration, or from damage or loss. We take all reasonable and actionable measures to protect your personal information. For example:

We use mainstream security means such as SSL to encrypt many of our services. We regularly review our practices regarding information collection, storage, and processing (including physical security measures) to protect our systems from unauthorized access or alteration.

Subject to relevant regulations, we have appointed a person in charge of personal information protection and set up a personal information protection task force. We have also established relevant internal control processes to ensure compliance with the principle of least privilege. We strictly control access to personal information and only grant access permissions to our employees and those of an authorized service provider who need to access personal information in order to help us process such information. These employees are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. If they fail to perform these obligations, they may be held legally liable or be terminated. Personal information access logs will be kept and audited periodically. Employees who need to access sensitive personal information must obtain permission from relevant management personnel. In addition, we take technical measures to prevent people from accessing, modifying, copying, or downloading such information without authorization.

The security of your information is very important to us. Therefore, we will continue our efforts to protect the security of your personal information and implement safeguards such as encrypting stored data and using end-to-end encryption during transmission to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. In addition, certain encrypted data is inaccessible to anyone other than the user.

When transmitting and storing your personal information of special types, we will use security measures such as encryption. When storing your personal biometric information, we will take technical measures to process it, such as only storing a summary of your personal biometric information.

We carefully select business partners and service providers and include our requirements for personal information protection in our business contracts, audits, or assessments.
